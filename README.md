## Problem 73 - Counting Fractions in a Range

Consider the fraction, *n*/*d*, where *n* and *d* are positive integers.
If *n* < *d* and HCF(*n*,*d*) = 1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for *d* ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

$$\frac{1}{8},
\frac{1}{7},
\frac{1}{6},
\frac{1}{5},
\frac{1}{4},
\frac{2}{7},
\frac{1}{3},
\mathbf{\frac{3}{8},
\frac{2}{5},
\frac{3}{7}},
\frac{1}{2},
\frac{4}{7},
\frac{3}{5},
\frac{5}{8},
\frac{2}{3},
\frac{5}{7},
\frac{3}{4},
\frac{4}{5},
\frac{5}{6},
\frac{6}{7},
\frac{7}{8}$$

It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.

How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for *d* ≤ 12,000?
